Active Authentication/WebIDs
	Active Authentication:
		Touch-based Biometrics: Swipe patterns, Mouse movements, Touch Dynamics, keystroke
	
		The Idea: 
			Indidivudauls gain access currently using their biometrics and WebID info. 
			We want to include active authenticaton for verifaication of an individual's identity. 
			
			Consider how to store indiviuals active authentication biometrics as well as how to relate active authentication with their WebID (the WebID already provides individual's server location so that problem may already be solved)
			
			
			
			
		Concerns:
			Multiple individuals using the same device
			Multiple UserIDs
			Idle Machine (last use--collect---locked out) = Hibernation
			Behavioral data in time increment (collection entire time or in increments? When does that start?)
			Enroll Behavioral Data?... Periodic renrollment?
