Active Authentication/WebIDs
	Active Authentication:
		Touch-based Biometrics: Swipe patterns, Mouse movements, Touch Dynamics
		The Idea: 
			Indidivudauls gain access currently using their biometrics and WebID info. 
			We want to include active atuhenticaton for verifaication of an individual's identity. 
			
			Consider how to store indiviuals active authentication biometrics as well as how to relate active authentication with their WebID (the WebID already provides individual's server location so that problem may already be solved)
